    My Dear Vaccinated Friends: You will still get it and still transmit it. Your immunity will be inferior to that of the unvaxxed that have had covid. You'll need a booster every 6 months for life. At best you get reduced symptoms for a short time. Be mad at those that lied to you - not the unvaxxed!

    Additionally, your vaccinated body is forcing the virus to promote variants that will circumvent current vaccines and will promote others to evade future vaccines.

    Everything that is unflattering to the vaccination campaign regarding vaccine failure and vaccine side effect / death is being downplayed or hidden from you. Scientific discoveries regarding vaccine-related problems will not reach you as they are squashed by social media and the medical community. Dissenting voices are silenced directly or due to fear of losing a job or being shunned by society. Other medications that might save the world are being suppressed to keep the "all must vax" narrative alive, and maybe also for pharma profits. Politically, the administration can not afford to be seen as doing nothing, so they will promote vaccination - even if it's the wrong course of action. It may be impossible to stop since to admit that they were wrong would be a catastrophe for them - but to continue will be a catastrophe for us.

    Down the road you will realized you've been lied to -- perhaps with the best intentions, or perhaps not; but lied to just the same. The only question is what will "down the road" look like by the time we get there? In the front of everyone's mind is the virus, but in the back, consciously or subconsciously, this is also about "owning the political opposition." Please let go of that, do the research, follow the data, and see where this is heading before it's too late.
